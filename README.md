# Overview of the Project

Beks is a data scientist and a programmer for a non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup. They are philantropist foundation dedicated to helping organisations that protect the environment and help people's wellness and unify the world.

Alphabet soup has raised and donated over ten billion dollars in the past twenty years. This money has been used to invest in a life saving technologies.Beks is in charge of data collection and analysis for the entire organization. Her job is to analyse the impact of the donation and vet potential recipients.These helps insure that the foundation money is been used effectively. Unfortunately not every donation the company made is impactful.

In some cases an organisation will take the money and disappear.As a result, Alphabet Soup top management has asked Beks to pridict which organaztion are worth donating to and which are too high risk.He wanted her to create mathematical data driven solution that can do this accurately.

I was approached to help Beks learn about Neural Network Model and how to design and train these models using the python tensorflow library.

This project is out to create a robust Deep Neural Network capable of interpreting large complex datasets.These models will help Beks and Alphabet soup determine which organizations should recieve donations.
